#### A webpack workflow for Web Components

Create standards compliant web components that work in supporting browsers. No frameworks, no proprietary code! Looking forward to the day when all browsers support web components and ES6 syntax. 

The webpack configuration generates a single bundle containing all of your components, as well as optional polyfills for non-supporting browsers.

## Scripts
- `npm start` - Use for development. This runs the project in the webpack dev server.
- `npm run build` - Builds a `/dist` directory containing everything you need to upload to your server or add to an existing project.
- `npm run wc:create` - Creates web component boilerplate files.
- `npm run wc:delete` - Deletes a web component from your project.
